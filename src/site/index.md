## What is educational therapy?

Learning challenges can profoundly impact students’ ability to prosper — in school and beyond. Educational Therapists (ETs) have graduate-level training in highly-individualized, evidence-based learning tools. ETs use these advanced tools, in one-to-one settings, to help children and adults identify and overcome learning challenges.

Educational Therapists may also lead teams of professionals, including teachers, other therapists, physicians and counselors. These teams work in concert to help students succeed and prosper.

Educational therapy works in two related ways: demystifying learning problems and developing learning strengths. The results can dramatically impact the student and often improve their relationships with family and peers.

## Who needs educational therapy?

Whether you are considering ET for yourself or someone else, ET benefits those who need reading, writing, math or homework help. ET addresses issues with:

- Memory training
- Attention awareness
- Executive functioning
- Phonemic awareness
- Auditory processing
- Verbal processing
- Visual-motor perception and skills
- Sequential and spatial ordering
- Higher order cognition
- Social cognition
- Traumatic brain injury

## How does educational therapy work?

Educational Therapists work with clients, one-to-one, in homes, offices and schools. ETs help clients develop individualized skills to overcome their specific developmental, neurological, and learning challenges.

An ET will often start with non-threatening activities, such as games, to create a positive relationship (a therapeutic alliance).

The ET carefully analyzes the client’s school work and reviews assessments, if available, to customize an educational treatment plan and identify educational therapy goals. These goals are based on the client’s academic needs, in addition to their social-emotional, psychoeducational and neuropsychological needs.

The ET and the client, working together, make progress toward the identified therapy goals, using evidence-based tools and techniques that are engaging, fun, and rewarding.

The ET provides periodic, detailed progress reports, and works hand-in-hand with parents to achieve amazing results.
