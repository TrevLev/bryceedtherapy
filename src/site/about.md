After my own two special needs children were grown, I trained as an Educational Therapist. Each of my children is amazing, and each has daunting challenges.

Before I started my graduate training in ET, I already had more than a dozen years of education experience, both as a credentialed classroom teacher, resource teacher, and one-on-one instructor for Lindamood-Bell and Sylvan.
Before my teaching career, I worked as a corporate trainer, after getting a Master’s Degree in Organizational Psychology at Claremont Graduate University. I live in West Los Angeles and serve the surrounding community.

My philosophy: Mistakes should be embraced and celebrated — mistakes are powerful educators. I facilitate learning by encouraging students to “own” their own successes. I believe students prosper in a safe, warm, rewarding environment, where they learn to “fish” for themselves, and become better able to face future challenges.
